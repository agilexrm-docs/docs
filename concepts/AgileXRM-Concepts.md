  - How long each activity takes to complete
  - What path the process has taken
  - See status of each task
  - View/Change process data
  - Navigate in the process hierarchy

- Control Flow: when required, it is possible to jump back or forth within a process instance, 
  stop and resume it, and always maintaining full traceability.  
- In-flight process migration: **AgileXRM** can run multiple versions of the same process at the 
  same time and Process Manager can migrate a running process instance, or a selection of instances, 
  from one version to another.
