## Introduction

This QuickStart document describes how to create a sample process from scratch.

The content of the process is oriented to show several **AgileXRM** features using
the components of the platform:

- **AgileXRM Envision**: For Modeling the Process and the Dialog

- **AgileXRM Process Manager**: For viewing and visually managing the Process

The sample process here is not based on a real scenario; the idea is to show the
basic concepts of AgileXRM.

The walkthrough starts with a very simple Process and through the following
stages, new activities and steps are added.

The time needed to complete this walkthrough is around **50 minutes**.

## Quick Start Pre-requisites

This document assumes that:
<!--
-   Publish the managed solution **AgileXRMQuickStart_1_0_0_1_managed.zip** to
    CRM. It contains all the necessary entities and customizations to run this
    QuickStart guide successfully.

-   Publish the Dialog called **Update Children Entity Dialog**. It contains a
    predefined SubDialog that we will be using along with this walkthrough
    guide.

-   There are some sample Contact records (if not add them now).

-   You have an Activated and working copy of Visio 2010 / 2013 (can be Trial
    version, but should be Activated)
-->

- The following actions need to be done only once, the very first time you use the modeler.If not was previosly performed , do them now:
  - [Configure the process modeler remote connection](EnvisionRemoteConfiguration.md)
- Enable CDS entitites

<!--
    -   If you get a message box that says *AgilePoint Envision requires macro
    enabled. Do you want to enable it?* Click **Yes**

-   In the message box that says *AgilePoint Envision has updated template path.
    Please Restart Visio* click **OK**  
    (This window may be behind the Visio window - click on the Taskbar icon to
    bring it in view)

-   Close **Visio**
-->

## Stage 1: Designing and running your first process

Duration: **10 minutes**

Objectives: Show basic concepts of modeling, publishing and running a process

### Scenario

We have a custom entity in CRM called *Parent Entity.* The process will manage
the lifecycle of *Parent Entity*. We will create a CRM Task and when this Task
is *completed*, the Status of the record will be changed to *Inactive*.

### Create the process template

- Launch **Envision** from your computer and connect to your organization. If you have any issue to execute ENVISION check this guide: [Configure the process modeler remote connection](EnvisionRemoteConfiguration.md)

- When ENVISION is loaded the first step we need to do is create an AgileXRM application.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_01.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_01.png)

    The actions toolbar will allow you to:
  - Change your environtment connection
  - Create Applications
  - Create AgileDialogs process templates
  - Create AgileXRM process templates

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_01_00.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_01_00.png)
    > Also action toolbar allows you to search your process templates.

### Create a new AgileXRM Application

An AgileXRM application is a logical grouping of AgileXRM and AgileDialogs Process templates  

![AgileXRMQuickStart_01_01.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_01_01.png)

Provide an Aplication name.  

![AgileXRMQuickStart_01_02.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_01_02.png)

Created application is shown as a Folder view in Environment Explorer.  

![AgileXRMQuickStart_01_03.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_01_03.png)

The process is deployed and ready to be executed.

### Running the process

An AgileXRM process can be initiated in several ways:

- From a portal using a URL

- From AgileXRM web parts in a SharePoint site

- By calling AgilePoint web services

- By AgilePoint Event Service (scheduler, file drop, incoming email etc.)

- Using a CRM Workflow or Plugin

In this example, we are going to create a CRM Workflow to start the process:

- In CRM, go to Settings Processes New

- In Create Process window, type **Process name** as *Launch AgileXRM QuickStart Process,* Select *Parent Entity* in **Entity** drop-down and set
    **Category** to *Workflow* and click OK.

![AgileXRMQuickStart_18.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_18.png)

- A new Workflow is creat for the *Parent Entity*

- Select to start when **Record is created**

- **Add Step**: *Start AgileXRM Process*

![AgileXRMQuickStart_19.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_19.png)

Configure the step to launch the previously created process:

- Select *AgileXRM QuickStart Process* in the **ProcessName** lookup

- **Save** the Workflow and **Activate** it, confirm activation and **Close**
    the Workflow

![AgileXRMQuickStart_20.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_20.png)

- Create a new *Parent Entity* record and call it *Parent Record 1*

![AgileXRMQuickStart_21.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_21.png)

- Click **Save & Close**, wait a few seconds so that CRM Workflow is executed and then click F5 to refresh the record

- Double-click on the created Parent Record, and notice that the attached process has been executed.  
    (If such process instance does not appear, it means that the environment has not been set up correctly - Please create a Post in the Forum [forum.agilexrm.net](http://forum.agilexrm.net/) under **Installation & Setup Discussions** to get help)

![AgileXRMQuickStart_22.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_22.png)

Congratulations! You've successfully launched your very first AgileXRM Process!

Now let's complete the Task created by the process and see the process move
forward:

- On **Activities** section, focus on **Task 1** and click **Complete.**

![AgileXRMQuickStart_23.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_23.png)

- Refresh the screen (by pressing **F5**), check **View Process** section and
    notice that the process has continued past *Task 1* to *Set Inactive Status*
    and inactivated the record and finished  
    (This record will now be under the **Inactive Parent Entities** View)

![AgileXRMQuickStart_24.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_24.png)

- Click **F5** to refresh the record and notice that **Status** is now
    *Inactive* and **Status Reason** is *approved* and all fields are now
    read-only. The second activity in the process made this change.

This concludes this stage.

## Stage 2: Using Activity-based Forms with AgileDialogs

Duration: **5 minutes**

Objectives:

- Show the use of activity-based forms in processes - each activity has its
    own specific form

- Show that these forms can expose all the fields necessary to complete the
    task without having to navigate elsewhere, including fields from related
    entities.

 Stage 2: Scenario

In this stage we are going to add an AgileDialogs Form to be used in Task 1;
such Form is going to contain the input fields to be filled in by the user. We
will also add a second shape which will update the underlying entity with the
chosen values.

### Associate a form to a Task

- Open the process in Envision (Visio) that was created in Stage 1

    Select the shape *Task 1* and in the **Design Task**, click **XRM** category

- In the **PageForm property**, click the **ellipsis** button to show a new AgileDialogs Form, ready to be configured

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_25.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_25.png)

- Now, we will be associating an AgileDialogs form to Task 1. For that  goal, a predefined template is going to be used. Once the AgileDialogs Form is opened, click on **Import Form**.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_26.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_26.png)

- Look for the provided template **AgileDialogs_Task1.xml** and click **Open**. If the importation process has succeeded, the form should be visible and ready to be saved and deployed, as shown below.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_27.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_27.png)

- Click on **Save** to persist changes on *Task 1* shape.

- Back on the main menu, drag and drop another **Update Entity** shape (from  the **XRM Automatic Activities** stencil) on to the canvas.

- Name it *Update Parent Entity*.

- Select the shape, and click on **XRM**. Then, choose **EntitySpecification**, clicking on the ellipsis button.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_28.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_28.png)

- **Link** the Parent Entity fields against the process context variables that
    we have created in **Task 1**, accordingly. This can be accomplished by
    choosing the entity field name (on the left handside of the properties
    menu), and map it against the process context variable name (on the right
    handside, as shown below).

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_29.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_29.png)

- **Connect it** as shown, between *Task 1* and *Set Inactive Status* shapes

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_30.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_30.png)

- Click on **Update Parent Entity** and select **Help** in the menu to open contextual help for this shape (You can also right-click the shapes in the stencil and click **Help** to see contextual help).

- **Close** the Help window.

### Publish and test new process

- In **AgilePoint ribbon,** click **Publish Process to Server** to deploy new
    version of process.

- **Save** the Visio diagram (Hint: Name the file the same as the Process
    name, that is *AgileXRM QuickStart Process*)

- In CRM, create a new *Parent Entity* record to kick-off the new version of
    the process called **Parent Record 2**

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_31.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_31.png)

- The process is started automatically. Click on **Task 1** and then, click
    again on **Open Task**.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_32.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_32.png)

- The AgileDialogs Form will be shown on screen. Type the values you want to
    update for **Parent Entity 2**. Finish by pressing **Submit**, and click on
    **Mark Complete** afterwards.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_33.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_33.png)

- Back to the main screen, it is noticed that the process flow has kept going
    forward, the shape *Update Parent Entity* has been processed automatically
    and the process has been terminated. Please note the updated fields on
    *Parent Entity 2*.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_34.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_34.png)

This concludes this stage.

## Stage 3: Updating Child Entity records

Duration: **5 minutes**

Objectives:

- Show that certain shapes can make use of predefined SubDialogs that take
    parallel actions to the main process.

- Show that Option Set fields can be set based on a variable (not hardcoded).

- Show that you can update the mentioned child entities making use of
    predefined shapes.

- Show the use of Schema Picker window and the Query Expression window.

### Scenario

In this stage we are going to create children entities of *Child Entity* type attached to our *Parent Entity* record in CRM, all by using our process template. For that goal, a new shape will be added with functionality to add those children entities through AgileDialogs interface.

### Adding new Dialog Task shape

- In the Visio diagram, drag and drop a **Dialog Task** shape from **XRM Automatic Activities 2011** stencil, and name it *Update Children Entity Dialog*, as it is being shown below.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_35.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_35.png)

- **Select the shape** and, in the Property Grid, select the value **Mark as    completed** for the property **AfterSubmitAction**.

- Click on the property **Dialog** by clicking on its ellipsis button. If asked, connect to the server clicking **OK**.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_36.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_36.png)

- After connecting, select the previously published Dialog *Update Children Entity Dialog* (provided along with the rest of the necessary resources) as the chosen process template.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_37.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_37.png)

- Later, click on the property **InParameters**; on the left handside, type the name **parentBeId** (SubDialog inner variable name); on the right handside, type **\$\{CrmBeId\}** (business entity Id that we will be passing to the mentioned dialog dynamically).

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_38.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_38.png)

- The SubDialog called *Update Children Entity Dialog* creates a whole new Dialog behind the scenes that executes itself in parallel, and depending of our main process. It will be getting the business entity Id (of type *Main Entity*), and will create / update entities of type *child entity* depending of the main entity running in the first place (picture of the template below). Go to **Parent Entities** and change the View to **Inactive Parent    Entities** (to see the records created before).

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_39.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_39.png)

- Now, publish the main process against CRM, by clicking **Publish Process to
    Server**.

- Once published, we should run a new instance of the process. For that goal,
    go to **WorkPlace** and select **Parent Entities**.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_40.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_40.png)

- Choose the entity we used before and click on **Activate**. Once done, click
    on the ellipsis menu for the entity record, and choose **Run Process**.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_41.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_41.png)

- A pop-up menu comes up. Click on the **play** button for the *AgileXRM
    Quickstart process*.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_42.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_42.png)

- Refresh the page, and a new instance for the process will be launched. Click
    again on **Task 1**, **Open Task**, and fill in the form as you did on **Stage
    2**.

- If everything went as expected, the process flow will be reaching the SubDialog. That means, that a new dialog has been launched on parallel and it is ready for showing its associated dialog.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_43.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_43.png)

- Click on the shape, and select **Open Task**. Such task will be opened on a new popup window. The first form is showing us the list of child entity records that are associated to this main record of type *main entity* (image below).

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_44.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_44.png)

- We can edit the records inside the grid to update values, or adding new records by ressing **Add Child Entity**. Press that button and a new form is shown, to type the record values (*name* and *child option set* fields).  Type those, and press **Next**.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_45.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_45.png)

- We have gone back to the main form, and the new record is being shown. If we want to edit the mentioned field, we will click on the row we want to edit (record).

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_46.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_46.png)

- The edition form is shown as well. Type the new values you want and press
    **Next** again.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_47.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_47.png)

- Lastly, press **Finish**, and the whole SubDialog will have come to an end.
    The flow will have gone back to the main process, that it is going to be
    over after the entity is deactivated.

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_48.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_48.png)

This concludes this stage.

## Stage 4: Changing process flow at runtime

Duration: **5 minutes**

Objectives:

- Show that end users with the right permissions can control the flow of the
    process (jump from any step to any step - forward or backward) while
    maintaining details for audit purposes.

## Scenario

In this stage we are going to skip a process activity at runtime.

### Change the flow

- Create a new *Parent Entity* record and make sure to select a Contact. This
    will start a new process

- In the record form go to **View Process** section and click the **Change
    Flow** button

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_50_1.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_50_1.png)

- In the **Real-Time Flow Change** window select *Task 1* (the red square means that this task will be cancelled) and *Task 2* (the green square means that this is the destination activity) and click **OK** (Observe how the flow has changed and affected the CRM Tasks)

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_49.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_49.png)

- Leave this process instance running. Do not complete *Task 2*. It is needed in the next Stage

This concludes this stage.

## Stage 5: Process migration

Duration: **10 minutes**

Objectives:

- Show how a user with the right permissions, can migrate a running instance of a process to a new version of the process definition, to handle changing business requirements.

- Show branching mechanisms in processes and how these can loop back if required

## Scenario

In this stage we are going to modify the process definition and migrate the process instance that we have left running in the previous stage to the new version of the process. The new process definition will include a multiple condition shape with a loop and a shape to update the Status of all child records.

### Add the multiple condition shape

We want to go back to *Task 1* if the Option Set field in Task 2 is set to the
value *Option 1*:

- Drag and drop a **Multiple Condition** shape from **Generic** stencil onto
    the canvas  
    (when this shape is added, the configuration window opens automatically)

- In the **New Condition Activity** window, enter *Parent Option Set 1* in the
    **Name** field in the **Data Binding** field click the **ellipsis** button
    to open **Schema Picker** window

- Type *option* in the **Search Variable** field to help locate the desired
    field

- Select the *name* attribute of **ParentOptionSet1** field to use it in the
    condition

- Click **OK** to close the window

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_50.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_50.png)

- Click **OK** to open the Condition window

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_51.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_51.png)

- Click the **New** button to open the **Expression** window

- Type *Option 1* in **Value** and click **OK** to close the **Expression**
    window

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_52.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_52.png)

- Click **Close** to close the Condition window

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_53.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_53.png)

### Add the multiple change status shape

- Drag and drop a **Set Status (Multi)** shape from the **XRM Automatic
    Activities** stencil and name it *Set Children Status*

- Under **XRM category** in Property Grid, set **Entity Name** property to
    *Child Entity* and set **Status** property to *Closed-Inactive*

As the query expression for this shape is the same as the earlier *Update
Children* step, let's copy the query definition:

- Click on the *Set Children OptionSet* shape to see its properties in the
    grid

- In the **QueryExpression** property, double-click on the value part to
    select the content

- Right-click the selected content, select **Copy** menu item to copy the
    content  
    (Do NOT use CTRL+C as it copies the whole shape and not just the value of
    the property grid)

- Click the *Set Children Status* shape to see its properties in the grid

This concludes this stage.

## Stage 6: Using AgileDialogs

Duration: **10 minutes**

Objective:

- Show the use of dialogs instead of forms in completing a task.

### Scenario

An AgileXRM task can be associated to a dialog created using AgileDialogs instead of an AgileLightForm. These dialogs are used to gather information from the user via a wizard-like interface.

We are going to change *Task 1* to use a predefined dialog instead of an AgileLightForm.

### Deploy the Dialog

The dialog is already modeled and is stored in a Visio file where the SDK isinstalled (normally in C:\\Program Files(x86)\\AgileXRM\\SDK\\Samples\\QuickStart )

- Locate the *QuickStart AgileDialog.vsd* file

- Open the file with Visio - You'll get an *Unable to connect to the remote
    server* error. Click **OK**.

- The Connection window pops-up. Ensure that the connection configuration is
    pointing to your CRM Server and organization, and click **OK**

- Publish this dialog following the same instructions under Publish Process in
    Stage 1, including adding the Process Permissions

### Adding the Dialog Task

- In Visio switch to **AgileXRM QuickStart Process model**, remove *Task 1* by
    clicking it to select it and then pressing **Delete**

- Click on **ShapesMore > ShapesAgilePointXRM > AgileDialogs** to open the stencil

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_56.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_56.png)

- Drag and drop a **Dialog Task** shape and name it *Dialog 1*

    In the property grid, under XRM, click the ellipsis button of the **Dialog**
    property to open *Process Selector* window

- Select *QuickStart AgileDialog* under Process Template and click **OK**

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_57.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_57.png)

- Connect the shapes and publish the process as before

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_58.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_58.png)

- Create a new *Parent Entity* record to start a new process instance

- Open *Dialog 1* activity and notice this time a dialog is presented to us

- Fill the different controls on this page and click the **Next** button  
    (Notice there are validations, CRM Option sets, CRM Lookups and Datetime
    controls)

    ![AgileXRMQuickStart_59.png](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_59.png)

- Click the **Back** button and change some of the fields and click **Next** again

- Click the **Viewer** button to see the model for the dialog (This button is not normally visible to end-users)

- Click Next until the dialog is completed

Notice that when the dialog is finished the process continues to the next step.

This concludes this stage.

## Stage 7: Starting Processes from SharePoint


> **NOTE**: This stage assumes you enabled a SharePoint Web Application when you
installed AgileXRM via the Quick Installer. If you did not, this stage cannot be
completed.

Duration: **5 minutes**

Objectives: Show that people outside CRM or even outside the company can
initiate and interact with processes (and dialogs)

## Scenario

We are going to start a process using a pre-created Start-Up Form from
SharePoint.

### Preparing SharePoint

It is assumed you are familiar with SharePoint.

-   Go to any page in any site in the Web Application that you enabled as part
    of the installation and Edit the page to add the 3 AgileXRM WebParts
    (similar to this below)

    ![](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_60.png)

### Setting StartUp Form

In order to allow starting a process from SharePoint, the process must have a
start-up form.

-   Open the previous **AgileXRM QuickStart Process** in Visio.

-   In AgileXRM Ribbon, click **AgileXRM Settings**

-   Go to **Start Up** tab and select *AgileXRM QuickStart StartUp Form* by
    clicking the ellipsis button and click **OK**

    ![](media/AgileXRMQuickStartGuide/AgileXRMQuickStart_61.png)

-   Publish the process as before

Since we are changing the launch method (via external web instead of via CRM
WF), we need to deactivate the CRM Workflow we created in Stage 1 so that we do
not end up with two instances of the process for the same record.

-   In CRM, go to **Settings > Processes** and **Deactivate** the launcher Workflow

### Initiate Process via SharePoint

-   In the **Initiate AgileXRM Process** WebPart, click on the process named
    *AgileXRM QuickStart Process* and on the menu that appears, click **Initiate
    New Process**

The start-up form is opened:

-   Fill the fields and click **Save Data** button

-   Note how a new *Parent Entity* record is created with its corresponding
    process initiated

This concludes this stage.
