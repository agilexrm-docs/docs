This shape is used to launch a SubDialog.

## Configuration

A SubDialog is similar to a sub-process in **AgileXRM**. SubDialogs always share the
context with the parent dialog. They can be included anywhere in the parent
dialog and multiple levels are allowed, so a SubDialog can contain other
SubDialogs.

## Dialog Property

This window is used to configure the SubDialog to run:

| **Property**| Description |
|---|---|
| **Process Template** | Select which dialog to run, from the list of AgileDialogs already deployed to the Process Engine |
| **Latest Version**| The latest version of the SubDialog will be used at runtime |
| **Specific Version (\*)** | The selected version will always be used |
| **Latest Major Version (\*)** | The highest minor version of the selected major version is used |
| **My Dynamic Major Version (\*)** | The same as Latest Major Version but the major version number is the calling dialog's Major Version |
| **Start Latest Version (if not found)** | This configures the behavior of the shape if the version setting above is one of the ones with an (\*) and that version does not exist at runtime. In the case it will behave as if Latest Version was selected |
| **Throw an exception (if not found)** | This configures the behavior of the shape if the version setting above is one of the ones with an (\*) and that version does not exist at runtime. In the case it will make the shape throw an Exception (i.e. process hangs in this shape until the problem is remedied) |

## NamePrefix property

The *NamePrefix* property can be used to set a readable name for the SubDialog
instance. This name is used in *AgileXRM Process Manager* to show a hyperlink to
the SubDialog.
