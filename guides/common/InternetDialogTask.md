> **NOTE**: This activity can only be used in an **AgileXRM** process template. It
cannot be used in AgileDialogs templates.

The activity creates a manual task that is completed when a Dialog is completed. The dialog is presented to the external user in the Portal. The **AgileXRM** process will continue when the dialog is completed. If the dialog is canceled, a process variable called *DialogCanceled* is set to *true.* This variable can be used to take decisions in the process.

## Configuration

The configuration is the same as the **AgileXRM** Manual Task shape; the only
difference is that there is a *Dialog* property instead of a *Form* property.

### Dialog property

The dialog to be executed by the user is selected using *Dialog* property:

|**Property**| Description |
|---|---|
| **Process Template**| Select which dialog to run, from the list of AgileDialogs already deployed to the Process Engine|
| **Latest Version**| The latest version of the SubDialog will be used at runtime |
| **Specific Version (\*)** | The selected version will always be used |
| **Latest Major Version (\*)** | The highest minor version of the selected major version is used |
| **My Dynamic Major Version (\*)** | The same as Latest Major Version but the major version number is the calling dialog's Major Version |
| **Start Latest Version (if not found)** | This configures the behavior of the shape if the version setting above is one of the ones with an (\*) and that version does not exist at runtime. In the case it will behave as if Latest Version was selected |
| **Throw an exception (if not found)** | This configures the behavior of the shape if the version setting above is one of the ones with an (\*) and that version does not exist at runtime. In the case it will make the shape throw an Exception (i.e. process hangs in this shape until the problem is remedied) |

### InParameters property

The dialog can receive input parameter from the calling process. These parameters can be either static values or dynamic values using the `${variable}` syntax.

### OutParameters property

This configuration is used to set context variables in calling process from values gathered in the dialog.

![InternetDialogTask_04.png](../media/AgileDialogsDesignGuide/InternetDialogTask_04.png)

The *Name* column contains the name of the variable to create in calling process and *Dialog Variable* column contains the name of the variable in dialog to get value from.
