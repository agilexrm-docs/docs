Configuring permissions for AgileDialogs works like configuring permissions for
**AgileXRM** processes. When a Dialog is deployed to server the modeler can
configure permissions using the same mechanism.

Process permission can be managed using Process Security button in **AgileXRM** Ribbon.

Runtime Permissions have the same configuration options as for **AgileXRM** processes

And permission can be assigned based on XRM roles:

In order to launch a Dialog the user must belong to a role that has *Initiate Process* permission.
