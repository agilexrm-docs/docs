This control is used to allow the user to upload files.

It can be configured in two modes using the *AllowMultiple* property:

- **Single file**: AllowMultiple=False only allows to upload one single file.

If the browser supports it, the File control allows **drag & drop** of files from
the PC (e.g. Internet Explorer 11):

The maximum size (in Bytes) allowed can be configured in the property *MaxFileSize*.

Uploaded files are stored as an attachment to a custom entity in XRM called *AgileDialogs Temp Attachments* (Part of the AgileXRM CRM Solution).

Also, file control can be configured to delete the uploaded file using the
*AllowDelete* property. When *AllowDelete* property is set to true, file control
will show a button to delete the attachment.

> **Note**: For previously uploaded files, AgileDialogs does not delete the attachment
until the Next button is clicked.
