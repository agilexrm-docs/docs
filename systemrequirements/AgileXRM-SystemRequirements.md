## Introduction

This document describes the supported system requirements for installing
the components of the product suite. The following components are
included in the product suite:

- Process Server (incl. Administration Portal)
- Process Manager
- Envision Process Modeler
- Dynamics 365 CE/Dataverse/CDS Integration
- AgileDialogs
- SharePoint Integration (Optional)
- External Connector (Optional)

Requirements are kept in line with Dynamics 365 CE (CRM) System Requirements as described here:

<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/deploy/system-requirements-required-technologies>

**AgileXRM** supports **Microsoft Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service - CDS) of Power Platform** as well as any Apps built on top of Dyn365/Dataverse like **Microsoft Project Online**.

**AgileXRM** currently *does not* support Dynamics 365 for Operations or Finance and Business Central.

## Deployment Options

These are the different Deplyment Options that are supported:

|  #  | AgileXRM Installed in:                       | Dynamics 356 CE / Dataverse Online | Dynamics 365 CE/CRM installed in Azure VM | Dynamics 365 CE/CRM installed in non-Azure VM | Dynamics 365 CE/CRM installed in client On-Premise |
|-----|----------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|**A**| Public Cloud (*Shared*)                      |**Y**|  N  |  N  |  N  |
|**B**| Public Cloud (*Dedicated*)                   |**Y**|**Y**| (*) | (*) |
|**C**| Client Azure VMs<br/>(*Managed by AgileXRM*) |**Y**|**Y**| (*) | (*) |
|**D**| Client Azure VMs<br/>(*Managed by client*)   |**Y**|**Y**| (*) | (*) |
|**E**| Client Cloud non-Azure VMs                   | (*) |  N  |**Y**| (*) |
|**F**| Client On-Premises                           | (*) | (*) | (*) |**Y**|

> **(*)** : **Not-Recommended** but consult for these combinations, as it maybe supported under certain circumstances.

## Deployment Options A and B

---

### AgileXRM in Public Cloud (A-Shared)

This is a tenant in a multi-tenant shared **AgileXRM** Online pool.
One **AgileXRM** tenant can support any number of Dynamics 365 CE Online organizations and/or Dataverse/CDS Environments, as long as these are in the same Azure Region.
It is possible to connect to client's on-premise legacy systems via Azure AD Application Proxy.

### AgileXRM in Public Cloud (B-Dedicated)

This is a single tenant in a dedicated **AgileXRM** Online environment. Nothing is shared with any other client.
This can support any number of Dynamics 365 CE organizations (both installed or Online) and/or Dataverse/CDS Environments, as long as these are in the same Azure Region.
It is possible to connect to client's on-premise systems via Azure AD Application Proxy or Private VPN.

### Integration Requirements (Options A and B)

In order to integrate the **AgileXRM** Tenant with the client's Dynamics/Dataverse environment, the following are needed:

- Give Consent by an Azure AD Administrator at the Azure Tenant level by clicking on the following consent links:

## Server Requirements for Deployment Options C, D, E and F

**AgileXRM** is very flexible in that it can be installed on one single server for smaller
deployments or distributed in a High Availibility (HA) cluster for large deployments, including ScaleSets. The
components easily scale out. The information here applies to both physical
machines as well as virtual machines. VMs can also be in public Cloud like Azure
or other IaaS providers supported by Microsoft. For further information on
Virtual Machine support, please see Support for Virtualization Technologies further below.

### AgileXRM in Client Azure VM (Options C and D)

This is when **AgileXRM** is installed in client's Azure subscription.

There is an option that **AgileXRM** manages the environment as a Managed Service or the client maintains the environment themselves.

This can support any number of Dynamics 365 CE organizations and/or Dataverse/CDS Environments, as long as these are in the same Azure Region.

It is possible to connect to client's on-premise legacy systems via Azure AD Application Proxy or Private VPN.

#### AgileXRM Server Installation Prerequisites

In all **AgileXRM** Servers (64-bit only):

1.**Create a Domain User** to be used as a service account (i.e. non-expiring password).  
This user will also be used during the installation process, so it should be allowed to logon to the Windows Server, including via RDP.

- Add this user to **Local Administrator** group on the server
- Create a **mailbox** for the service account
- **Logon to the server** with this user and complete the rest of the tasks with this user

1.Turn off things that interfere with the installation (all can be turned back on after the installation):

- **Turn off Windows Firewall**
- **Turn off AntiVirus**
- **Disable UAC and reboot**

1.Decide which **ports** are going to be used. Normally these ports are used:

- AgileDialogs & ProcessManager: 443 (https) or 8888 (http)
- WCF Service: 444 (https) or 13487 (http)
- REST API: 443 (https) or 13490 (http)
- Admin Portal: 443 (https) or 13491 (http)

1.Decide which **host headers** are going to be used. Something like this: [can change *agilexrm* for other word)]

- AgileDialogs / ProcessManager: *agilexrm*.contoso.com
- REST API & WCF Service: *agilexrm*-api.contoso.com or *agilexrm*.api.contoso.com
- Admin Portal: *agilexrm*-admin.contoso.com or *agilexrm*.admin.contoso.com

1.If SSL is required then have a vaid **SSL Certificate** available that covers the chosen host headers  
  1.Have **.NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher** enabled/installed  
  1.Create the following **empty DBs** in SQL Server:

- **APDB**
- **APMasterPortalDB**
- **APTenantPortalDB**
- **APArchiveDB**
- Grant **db_owner** privilege to **service account** user in all DBs

1. Provide **access to SMTP server** for the service account to send emails
1. Install **Chrome or Edge** (Chromium version)
1. Copy **AgileXRM Installer** ZIP file onto the server
