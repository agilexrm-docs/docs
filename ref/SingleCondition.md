| -------- | ----------- |
| **Property Binding**| Click its ellipsis button to open the configuration dialog. The data binding expression that is used to evaluate the value of the condition at runtime. It shows the content of the Data Binding field in the Configuration Dialog, which would be a Dynamic Value (Process variable or Context data) that should evaluate to a Boolean (true, false, TRUE, FALSE, True, False, 0 or 1).<blockquote>**NOTE**: If the value is NULL (i.e. has no value) then it is treated as FALSE<blockquote/> |
