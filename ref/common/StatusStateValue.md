This is the value of the *Status Reason* to be used.

If the *Status* property is set from the drop-down, then this property is filled automatically. If however, the *Status* property is set to a variable, then you can also use a **$\{variable\}** for this property, and it should resolve to a *Status Reason* value (not the display name - e.g. 2 instead of *Inactive*)
