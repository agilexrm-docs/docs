> **Note**: Set the *EntityName* property first in order to fill the drop-down list of this property.

This combo field is for selecting the *Status* and *Status Reason* combination for the entity.

However, it can take a dynamic value by typing **$\{variable\}** which should resolve to a Status value (not the display name - e.g. 2 instead of *Inactive*)
