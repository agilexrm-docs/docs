Optional

This is for passing parameters from Dialogs to the calling Parent Process.

It is also possible to use the [**Update Parent Process**](../UpdateParentProcess.md) shape in the Dialog itself to update Process Variables in the parent process, but this way it is simpler to understand what the parent process expects back from the child dialog,
especially when the calling process could be any or it is not known when designing the Dialog.
