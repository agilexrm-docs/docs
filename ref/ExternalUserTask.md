These users are Dynamics 365/CDS Contacts and have a corresponding Username and Password stored in custom **AgileXRM** fields.
These users are identified in **AgileXRM** as a single user called AgileXRM\ExternalUser.
The task will be presented to the user outside the D365/CDS UI, for example, in a Dynamics 365 Portal, SharePoint or any other portal technology, where the user can interact with it.
