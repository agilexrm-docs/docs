![XRM SubProcess Multi](media/XRMSubProcessMulti.png)

This shape is used to start one sub-process for each record in a list. The list
can be the result of a query using the *QueryExpression* parameter or passed as
a semicolon-separated llist of IDs in the *EntityIds* parameter (in conjunction
with *EntityName*).

If the *Wait* parameter is set to *True*, the process continues once all the
subprocesses that were initiated by this shape are completed.

SubProcesses can be initiated sequentially or in parallel.

Typically this is used to manage the lifecycle of child entities, for example
Order Line Items of an Order.

## Shape-Specific Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **EntityIds**               | [Entity Ids](common/EntityIds.md)               |
| **EntityName**              | [Entity Name](common/EntityName.md)              |
| **ExecutionMode**           | Default value: **Parallel** <br /> - **Parallel** : All subprocesses are started in parallel in no particular order <br /> - **Sequential** : subprocesses are initiated one by one so next subprocess is not started until previous subprocess is completed (or cancelled)|
| **NamePrefix**              | [Name Prefix](common/NamePrefix.md)              |
| **QueryExpression**         | [Query Expression](common/QueryExpression.md)         |
| **RunProcessIndependently** | [Run Process Independently](common/RunProcessIndependently.md) |
| **SaveProcessInstanceIdTo** | [Save Process Instance Id To](common/SaveProcessInstanceIdTo.md) |
| **Sub Process**             | [SubProcess](common/SubProcess.md)             |
| **SubProcessInitiator**     | [SubProcess Initiator](common/SubProcessInitiator.md)     |
| **SubProcessParams**        | [SubProcess Params](common/SubProcessParams.md)        |
| **TargetVariableName**      | Optional<br> This property allows every child process instance to receive the ID of the entity against which the subprocess is executed, in a variable inside the child process (default: *CrmBeId*) |
| **Wait**                    | [Wait](common/Wait.md)                    |
