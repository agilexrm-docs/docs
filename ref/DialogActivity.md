![Dialog Activity](media/DialogActivity.png)

This shape is used in **AgileXRM** processes (not in AgileDialogs models) and can
create any type of CRM Activity with an associated AgileDialog.

> **NOTE**: The chosen Activity Type should have previously been Enabled in
**AgileXRM** Administration.

When the activity is opened in CRM, the AgileDialog starts for the user to
interact with.

When the AgileDialog is completed this activity is completed and the process
continues.

Use this shape rather than one of the other CRM Activities shapes, when a single Page
Form may not suffice or the user needs to be guided to complete the task.

## Participants

The property *ConfigureParticipants* allows to set the Activity owner and (optionally) assign the activity to a queue, just clicking on the ellipsis button.

To see full configuration navigate to the [Participants](./common/Participants.md) detailed section.
