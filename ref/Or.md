![Or](media/Or.png)

An activity that associates multiple activities with the *OR* condition
(non-exclusive / exclusive). Successful completion of one or more of the
associated activities will trigger the exit of this AgileShape.

In the *Exclusive* mode, this shape is useful for cancelling a route in a parallel
flow situation.

## Configuration Dialog

Configuration dialog is only available when the *Exclusive* property is set to
*True*.

## Exclusive OR

Consider this example process extract:

![Or](media/Or1.png)

The dialog would show the following:

![Or](media/Or2.png)

| Field Name / Button | Definition|
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Nearest Incoming Activities**  | ReadOnly<br>Automatically lists all direct predecessors here. When the OR AgileShape is entered via one of these, the other one is automatically Cancelled if it was active at the time.|
| **Other Predecessor Activities** | Here it is possible to select any other predecessors to be Cancelled when OR AgileShape is entered. It is necessary to also select the corresponding *Cancel Manual Tasks* and/or *Stop System Tasks* to enable cancellation of the selection. |
| **Cancel Manual Tasks**          | When selected, any manual activities selected in the *Other Predecessor Activities* listbox are cancelled when process enters the OR AgileShape.|
| **Stop System Tasks**            | When selected, any automatic activities selected in the *Other Predecessor Activities* listbox are cancelled when process enters the OR AgileShape. |

> **NOTE**: If none of the checkboxes are selected, this shape behaves as if the  *Exclusive* property was set to *False*. If only *Cancel Manual Tasks* is checked, the manual tasks will be cancelled (nearest incoming and other predecessor activities), and in case of *Stop System Tasks*, both the nearest incoming activities and other predecessor that fit the category will be stopped.
