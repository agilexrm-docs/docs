![Change ownership (Multi)](media/ChangeOwnershipMulti.png)

> __NOTE__: DO NOT USE THIS SHAPE ANYMORE. **Use the Multi-Update shapes instead** which 
can now set the Owner column.

This shape is used to change the Owner of multiple entity records to another User or Team.

The set of records that are affected are selected by either:

* The ones returned by the query configured in the *QueryExpression* property
* From a semicolon-separated list of IDs passed via the *EntityIds* property

> **NOTE**: Owner field is a special field and cannot be changed using the *Update Entity (Multi)* shape.

## Shape-Specific Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **EntityIds**   | This could be a list of entity record IDs seperated with a semicolon (;). It can take dynamic variable(s)|
| **EntityName**| [Entity Name](common/EntityName.md)|
| **NewOwner**| This can be any of these: If *OwnerType* property is set to *User* then it can be either *CRM Domain Logon Name* (*domainname*) or *User* (*systemuserid*). If *OwnerType* property is set to *Team* then it must be the *Team ID.(teamid)* |
| **OwnerType**| This can be either **User** or **Team**|
