This shape is used in **AgileXRM** processes (not in AgileDialogs models) and will create a custom type of Dynamics365/CDS Activity with an associated AgileDialog.

Created activity can be assigned to a external user of Dynamics365/CDS platform.

The associated AgileDialog URL can be send to the user by email to allow the interaction with.

When the AgileDialog is completed this activity is completed and the process
continues.

Use this shape rather than one of the other CRM Activities shapes, when a single Page
Form may not suffice or the user needs to be guided to complete the task.
