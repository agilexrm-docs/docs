# Wait For Update

![Wait For Update](media/WaitForUpdate.png)

This activity is used to wait until a condition is met in CRM. This can be used
in many scenarios. For example:

-   Make all order items processes to wait until customer account credit rating
    becomes High.

-   Make a process wait until product stock is sufficient to fulfill an order

The process will wait until the condition configured in the query is met.

It is common to **Add a Timer** to this shape in order not to wait indefinitely.
This way when the due date is reached, the process will continue using the
alternative route:
